# Runbook

## Local setup

1. Install Python 3.12 and `uv`.
2. From the repository root, run `uv sync --locked --no-editable`.
3. Run a small, explicit time range before requesting a multi-year history.

The non-editable install is used because the editable-package path was not loading correctly in this local environment. Re-run the sync command after changing package code.

## Fetch a bounded batch

```sh
uv run quakewatch-extract \
  --site seattle \
  --start 2026-09-28T00:00:00Z \
  --end 2026-09-29T00:00:00Z
```

Supported public demo sites are `seattle`, `san-francisco`, and `anchorage`. Times without an explicit zone are interpreted as UTC. Output goes to `data/raw/<attempt-id>/` unless `--output` is provided. Keep private coordinates and credentials out of the repository.

## Inspect a run

Read `manifest.json` first. A successful manifest has status `complete`; each leaf query window should show matching `count_before`, `returned_rows`, and `count_after`. A failed run writes a failed manifest for investigation and retry. The source is not a durable event log, and a successful response does not prove gap-free catalog coverage.

## Snowflake access

Snowflake setup is not complete. Before configuring credentials, provision a project role with the minimum warehouse, database, schema, stage, table, and stored-procedure privileges required by the implementation. Store authentication material outside Git. Do not paste private keys or passwords into chat or commit them.
